 You can always contact me in one of these ways for anything but I prefer that you use the templates laid out in the other files in this repo. If you're contacting me about something not uncluded in those files then make sure to consicly explain why you are contacting me. Please avoid smapping me as I'm only human and might not reply straight away. I will see your message if you use one of these channels.
