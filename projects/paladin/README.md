# What is this?
Well isn't that obvious? it's my futile attempts at trying to make a full collection for the paladin class. In here you can find the finished parts of the code. What I'm working on and the code I have for those things, What I have of code for things that are not finished yet and what I'm going to work on next.

Unless I get requests from someone to focus on a subclass first I will work down the list. The execeptions will be, things that can't yet be fully automated, things that take a lot of effort. Those might be skipped.

## waiting for features in Draconinc
- Adding saves to attacks in an effect:
	- Mortal bulwark
- Acces to creaure type draconic.
	- All the turn channel divinity.
	- turn the faithless.
	- Adbjure the Extraplanar

IF you want me to work on something first let me know.
