# Avrae_things

Where I store all the code and explantions about that code for the Avrae bot. Not all the code here has been made by me, I will try and add credits to anything that has not been writen by me but if I fail to do so let me know by pinging me in the Avrae development server( @dice#6153), PMing me on discord ( @dice#6153) or opening a issue here.

#### Spelling mistakes
As you might guess from reading this text or the fact that I include this into this in my main README channel. If you find any spelling mistakes anywhere(inside aliases, snippets, this github, the workshop...) please contact me and tell me where the mistake was made, possible a screenshot of it and what it should be corrected to.

My native language is not English and I'm dyslexic so it's hard to always get things right. I try to use spellcheckers as much as possible but I know I make mistakes often.
